Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the feedback form.

HOW IT WORKS:

NAME INPUT FIELD:
. The user enters their name.
. If the name is empty or contains anything other than alphabets, an error message is shown.

FEEDBACK INPUT FIELD:
. The user enters their feedback.
. If the feedback is empty or contains anything other than alphabets, an error message is displayed.

BUTTONS:
. Thumbs-Up : When clicked, if both name and feedback are valid, a thank-you message is shown with the entered name. If not valid, an error message is shown.
. Thumbs-Down : When clicked, if both name and feedback are valid, an alert with a "We are sorry!" message appears. If not valid, an error message is shown.

VALIDATION RULES:
. Name: Must only contain alphabets (no numbers or special characters) and cannot be empty.
. Feedback: Cannot be empty.

ERROR MESSAGES:
. "Name cannot be empty."
. "Name should contain alphabets only."
. "Feedback cannot be empty."

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML: For the structure of the form.
CSS: For styling the form elements.
JavaScript: For form validation and handling button interactions.
